# 100bit_2_to_1_MUX
A combinational logic circuit which is capable of accepting several inputs and generating a single output is known as multiplexer or MUX. Thus, the multiplexer is a type of data selector which takes many inputs and gives a selected output. In a multiplexer, there are 2n input lines and 1 output line, where n is the number of select lines.
